## For Businesses & Merchants

Muvu empowers businesses to streamline delivery operations, work with multiple logistics partners, and manage everything through a single interface.

1. **Join the Muvu Network**  
   Sign up and access your personalized dashboard. You can create one or more companies under your account, each with its own configuration. Manage all aspects of operations—including delivery partners, connections, billing, and shipment tracking—from a centralized workspace tailored to your business.

2. **Connect Your Store or Application**  
   Choose the integration method that works best for your team:
   - **Custom APIs** – Integrate directly with Muvu using our developer-friendly, well-documented REST APIs.  
   - **SDKs** – Use our software development kits in languages like Python, Node.js, or PHP to speed up development.  
   - **Platform Plugins** – Leverage plug-and-play integrations for platforms like Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, and more.

3. **Select Delivery Providers**  
   Explore Muvu’s growing catalog of delivery partners. Enable one or multiple providers based on your business location, cost, speed, or reliability preferences. Muvu gives you the flexibility to change or add partners without technical overhead.

4. **Dispatch Orders with Ease**  
   Orders from your platform are automatically routed to the delivery partners of your choice via API, SDK, or plugin. Muvu handles the logic and communication to reduce manual work and avoid costly errors.

5. **Real-Time Shipment Tracking**  
   Track every stage of the delivery lifecycle—from pickup to drop-off—through Muvu’s dashboard or APIs. Real-time status updates are also available via webhooks and plugins, keeping you and your customers informed.

## For Delivery Providers

Muvu enables courier companies and delivery aggregators to gain exposure, receive more delivery requests, and optimize operations through a single integration point.

2. **Get Discovered by Businesses**  
   Your profile will be listed in the Muvu Catalog, where businesses can select you as their delivery partner. You can also initiate relationships by sending partnership offers to merchants on the platform.

3. **Real-Time Order Sync**  
   Once selected by a business, delivery requests will flow directly into your system in real time. Muvu handles all syncing and coordination, so you can focus on fulfillment—not back-end complexity.

4. **Detailed Shipment Management**  
   Manage your entire delivery pipeline through Muvu’s provider panel. Filter and organize shipments by time, order status, customer, or region to streamline your team’s day-to-day logistics.
