## Introduction
This manual is specifically designed for **delivery providers** using the Muvx platform.  
While e-commerce businesses (ECs) are responsible for creating and managing orders, delivery providers handle the execution and completion of those shipments.  

If you are looking for the **Admin Panel Manual for EC (Businesses)**, please refer to this link:  
[Admin Panel Manual for ECs](/documentation/admin-panel-manual-source-start)

The Delivery Provider Admin Panel gives logistics partners a dedicated space to:
- Monitor overall performance and shipment status  
- Manage and build partnerships with ECs  
- Review shipment details across all partners  
- Investigate integration errors through logs  
- Adjust account and integration settings  

The following sections provide a high-level explanation of each part of the Admin Panel for delivery providers.

---

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides delivery providers with a quick overview of their operations.  
It summarizes shipments at different stages, shows active connections with ECs, and highlights recent integration errors.  
This page helps providers understand logistics performance at a glance and quickly detect potential issues.

---

## Business Partner
This section lists the ECs a delivery provider is currently connected with.  
If no connections exist, the page offers the option to start new partnerships by adding an EC.  
It serves as the central place for managing business relationships through Muvx.

---

## Catalog
The catalog is a directory of ECs that are available for integration.  
Delivery providers can send connection requests from this section. Once an EC approves and a contract is signed, Muvx establishes the connection automatically.  
This feature helps providers expand their network and collaborate with new ECs efficiently.

---

## Shipments
The shipments page displays all orders received from connected ECs.  
Providers can track the full lifecycle of shipments, from creation to delivery, including pickup, in-transit, cancellation, or failure.  
This section is the primary space for delivery providers to manage and monitor deliveries.

---

## API Logs
The API logs section captures the full history of interactions between delivery providers and Muvx.  
It is mainly used for debugging and monitoring technical activity.  
By reviewing requests and responses, providers can ensure integrations are running smoothly and resolve issues when needed.

---

## Settings
The settings page contains account and integration configurations for delivery providers.  
It allows providers to manage preferences, user access, and other technical options to align operations with their business requirements.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This Admin Panel manual applies only to **delivery providers**.  
The interface may evolve over time, so the documentation is written at a high level to remain valid even if specific layouts or fields change in the future.
