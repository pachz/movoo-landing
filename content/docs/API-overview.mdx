Instead of managing multiple courier integrations, your system connects to Muvx once — and we handle the complexity behind the scenes.

This low-code, scalable API helps streamline your logistics workflow, reduce technical overhead, and speed up delivery operations.

### Order Lifecycle

Below is the typical **order status flow**:

1. **created** – Order created in Muvx by the shop
2. **accepted** – Accepted by Muvx or assigned to delivery
3. **dispatched** – Courier assigned and dispatched (if supported)
4. **picked_up** – Package picked up from the store (if supported)
5. **in_transit** – On the way to customer (if supported)
6. **delivered** – Successfully delivered
7. **cancelled** – Cancelled (by shop or Muvx)
8. **failed** – Delivery failed (e.g., customer unreachable)

Each status will be reflected in Muvx's system and, optionally, pushed to your system via a webhook.
