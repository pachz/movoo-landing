## Connections: Sources

### What is a Source?

In Muvu, a **Source** represents your online store, marketplace, restaurant app, or custom backend system that you'd like to connect to our platform. Once connected, your orders will seamlessly flow into Muvu, ready to be dispatched to selected delivery providers.

---

### 🧭 Sources Page Overview


On the **Sources** page, you can manage and view all integrated sources at a glance. Easily control multiple online stores or restaurant systems from one organized interface.

### 🔹 List of Sources

The **Sources** page shows all of your connected sales channels—whether they are e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, or custom backend systems.

There are two possible states for this page:

---

#### 1. When No Sources Are Connected

If you haven’t added any sources yet, the page will show a clear call-to-action prompting you to connect your first source. This is your starting point to begin sending orders through Muvu.

### 🔹 Add a Source

Integrating a new source in Muvu is a simple two-step process, designed to support various platforms and backend systems.

- **Custom API**:  
  Directly integrate using Muvu’s REST API for full flexibility.

- **Platform Plugins**:  
  Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, and other e-commerce platforms.

#### Step 2: Provide Source Information

After selecting an integration type, you’ll be prompted to provide the required configuration details. This may vary depending on the selected method.

- For **Custom API**, you simply need to provide a **Source Name** — an internal label for your source instance.
- For other integrations like Shopify or Java SDK, additional fields may appear (such as access tokens, domain info, or SDK keys), depending on what’s needed to establish the connection.
