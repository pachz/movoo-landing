## For Businesses & Merchants

Muvx empowers businesses to streamline delivery operations, work with multiple logistics partners, and manage everything through a single interface.

1. **Join the Muvx Network**  
   Sign up and access your personalized dashboard. You can create one or more companies under your account, each with its own configuration. Manage all aspects of operations—including delivery partners, connections, and shipment tracking—from a centralized workspace tailored to your business.

2. **Connect Your Store or Application**  
   Choose the integration method that works best for your team:

   - **Custom APIs** – Integrate directly with Muvx using our developer-friendly, well-documented REST APIs.
   - **SDKs** – Use our software development kits in languages like Python, Node.js, or PHP to speed up development.
   - **Platform Plugins** – Leverage plug-and-play integrations for platforms like Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, and more.

3. **Select Delivery Providers**  
   Explore Muvx’s growing catalog of delivery partners. Enable one or multiple providers based on your business location, cost, speed, or reliability preferences. Muvx gives you the flexibility to change or add partners without technical overhead.

<Banner title="Please Confirm Your Provider Agreement">
  Muvx acts solely as an integration platform and does **not** manage or
  negotiate delivery contracts, pricing, or service terms on your behalf. Before
  enabling any delivery provider, make sure your business has an active,
  pre-established agreement directly with that provider. Only select providers
  you are already contracted with.

4. **Dispatch Orders with Ease**  
   Orders from your platform are automatically routed to the delivery partners of your choice via API, SDK, or plugin. Muvx handles the logic and communication to reduce manual work and avoid costly errors.

5. **Real-Time Shipment Tracking**  
   Track every stage of the delivery lifecycle—from pickup to drop-off—through Muvx’s dashboard or APIs. Real-time status updates are also available via webhooks and plugins, keeping you and your customers informed.

6. **Easy Troubleshooting and Management**  
   If something goes wrong, Muvx’s built-in **Live Debugger** helps you test requests, monitor API health, and resolve integration issues quickly—without disrupting your workflow.

## For Delivery Providers

Muvx enables courier companies and delivery aggregators to gain exposure, receive more delivery requests, and optimize operations through a single integration point.

1. **Join the Muvx Network**  
   Sign up as a delivery provider and integrate with Muvx once. Your service becomes instantly available to every merchant using the platform—no need for separate partnerships or integrations.

2. **Get Discovered by Businesses**  
   Your profile will be listed in the Muvx Catalog, where businesses can select you as their delivery partner. You can also initiate relationships by sending partnership offers to merchants on the platform.

3. **Real-Time Order Sync**  
   Once selected by a business, delivery requests will flow directly into your system in real time. Muvx handles all syncing and coordination, so you can focus on fulfillment—not back-end complexity.

4. **Detailed Shipment Management**  
   Manage your entire delivery pipeline through Muvx’s provider panel. Filter and organize shipments by time, order status, customer, or region to streamline your team’s day-to-day logistics.
