After selecting a destination from the **Connections** list, you’ll be redirected to its detail page. This interface is divided into multiple tabs: **Overview**, **Shipment**, and **Settings**.

---

## Overview

The **Overview** tab offers a description of the destination's function and purpose.

---

## Shipment

The **Shipment** tab lists all shipments routed through this destination.

- Filter by status:
  `Created`, `Accepted`, `Dispatched`, `Picked Up`, `In Transit`, `Delivered`, `Cancelled`, `Failed`
- Table columns include:  
  `Integration ID`, `Source`, `Order ID`, `Created Date`, `Status`, `COD`, `Last Updated`

If there are no shipments yet, the table will display an empty state message.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows you to configure how the destination behaves in your environment.

You can:

- Edit the **Destination Name**
- Select between **Sandbox** and **Production** environments
- Toggle the **Integration Status**
- Manage **Linked Sources**, which are the Sources sending orders to this destination

**Depending on the delivery provider** selected for this destination, additional configuration options may appear in the Settings tab.
These options are specific to the provider’s requirements and capabilities.

Each linked source shows its current connection state (Connected/Disconnected).
