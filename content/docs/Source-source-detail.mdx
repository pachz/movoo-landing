## Debugger

Use the **Debugger** tab to test and validate your webhook integration in real-time.

### Webhook Testing

To simulate a status update and ensure your system is listening properly:

1. **Enter your Webhook URL** — this is the endpoint that will receive status change notifications.
2. **Provide the Order ID** — the unique ID generated by Muvu when the order was created.
3. **Provide the Integration Order ID** — the order ID from your e-commerce platform or restaurant system.
4. **Select a Status** — choose the order status you want to simulate (e.g., Accepted, In Transit, Delivered).
5. Click **Test Connection** to send a mock status update to your webhook.

The response will be displayed instantly, including:

- Request Payload  
- Response Payload  
- HTTP status code  
- Response time  
- Timestamp with success/failure indication

This allows you to confirm that your system is correctly receiving and handling webhook events.
