## What is a Destination?

In Muvx, a **Destination** represents a delivery provider (such as DHL, Shipa, or even the Autobot simulator) where your shipments are dispatched. Once connected, you can link your sources to a destination and start routing orders.

---

## Destinations Page Overview

On the **Destinations** page, you can enable new delivery providers, manage existing ones, and open detail pages for configuration and shipment tracking.

There are two possible states for this page:

---

### 1. When No Destinations Are Enabled

If you haven’t added any delivery partners yet, the page will show a clear call-to-action:

## Add a Destination

Adding a new delivery partner to your Muvx account is quick and straightforward.

### Step 1: Choose a Delivery Partner

Select from the catalog of available delivery providers

<Banner title="Please Confirm Your Provider Agreement">
  Muvx acts solely as an integration platform and does **not** manage or
  negotiate delivery contracts, pricing, or service terms on your behalf. Before
  enabling any delivery provider, make sure your business has an active,
  pre-established agreement directly with that provider. Only select providers
  you are already contracted with.

/>

Each provider card includes a short description and an **“Add Destination”** button.  
You can start with **Autobot** to test the full delivery flow without connecting a real courier service.

### About Autobot

**Autobot** is Muvx’s built-in test destination, ideal for simulating the full delivery lifecycle without needing a connection to a real courier service.

When you send a test order to Autobot, it will automatically progress through each delivery status—`Created`, `Accepted`, `Dispatched`, `Picked Up`, `In Transit`, and `Delivered`—**one step every 60 seconds**.  
This makes it perfect for testing webhook flows, validating your integration, and debugging how your system handles status updates.

<Banner title="Autobot for Seamless Testing">
  Use **Autobot** as a sandbox delivery provider to simulate the full shipment
  lifecycle. After sending an order to Autobot, its status will automatically
  update **every 1 minute**, helping you test how your system handles real-time
  delivery events.

### Step 2: Integration Setup

After selecting a delivery partner, you’ll be asked to configure the destination:

- **Destination Name** — a label to identify this delivery instance internally.
- **Select Sources** — choose one or more sources to connect to this destination.

<Banner title="Provider Requirements May Vary">
  Some delivery providers may ask for additional fields during setup, such as
  access tokens, service region, account credentials, or integration keys. These
  fields will appear dynamically based on the provider you select.

Click **“Complete Integration”** to save the destination and start routing shipments.

> After saving, the new destination will appear in your Destinations list, ready to be linked to one or more Sources.
