# Destinations

## What is a Destination?

In Muvu, a **Destination** represents a delivery provider (such as DHL, Shipa, or even the Autobot simulator) where your shipments are dispatched. Once connected, you can link your sources to a destination and start routing orders.

---

## Destinations Page Overview

On the **Destinations** page, you can enable new delivery providers, manage existing ones, and open detail pages for configuration and shipment tracking.

There are two possible states for this page:

---

### 1. When No Destinations Are Enabled

If you haven’t added any delivery partners yet, the page will show a clear call-to-action:

> Click **"Add Destination"** to browse the available delivery partners and choose one to get started.

---

### 2. When Destinations Are Enabled

Once you’ve added destinations, the list displays all enabled providers with the following info:

- **Destination Name**
- **Linked Sources**
- **Status**: `Pending`, `Connected`, etc.
- **Last Synced**
- **Action** button to open the detail page

> You can add more destinations anytime by clicking the **“Add Destinations”** button.

## Add a Destination

Adding a new delivery partner to your Muvu account is quick and straightforward.

### Step 1: Choose a Delivery Partner

Select from the catalog of available delivery providers:

Each provider card includes a short description and an **“Add Destination”** button.  
You can start with **Autobot** to test the full delivery flow without connecting a real courier service.

---

### Step 2: Integration Setup

After selecting a provider, configure your destination instance:

- Set the **Destination Name** (internal label)
- Some providers may request extra fields (e.g., tokens, credentials, regions)
