# Webhooks (Muvx â†’ Your System)

### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "id": "MOV123",
  "integration_order_id": "SHOP123456",
  "status": "delivered",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-16T08:42:00Z"
}
```

### Notes

- You will provide your **webhook URL** and **secret key** in the onboarding dashboard.
- We recommend verifying each request using **HMAC-SHA256** and the shared secret.
- If webhook delivery fails, Muvx will retry automatically with **exponential backoff**, up to **5 times**.
